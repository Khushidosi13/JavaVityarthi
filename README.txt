overview:
JavaVityarthi is a Java-based project created under the VITyarthi – Build Your Own Project initiative.
It demonstrates problem identification, solution design, modular Java implementation, documentation, and testing.

Project Objective:
- Identify a meaningful problem
- Design a technical Java-based solution
- Implement modules using OOP and Java concepts
